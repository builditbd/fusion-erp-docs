# Introduction

## Fusion Distribution Management Software

Fusion Incorporation Limited has a well-deserved reputation for quality service in the battery manufacturing and distribution sector in Bangladesh. Faced with challenges in human-managed system limitations and the ever-growing aggravation of keeping track of field operatives and distributors; the company decided to create their own distribution management system software in 2016. Since then itâ€™s been constantly upgrading the software with new features and checks & balances to help manage the business painlessly. And Fusion Incorporation Limited has grown to such a height that it can rival any top companies in the same trade with the benefits of the software.

Fusion Incorporation Ltd has decided to share their system so any such distribution business can use this software and stay ahead of the game.
